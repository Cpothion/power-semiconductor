The file gives a simplified linear method for turn-on transient modelling of the 3-pin SiC MOSFET.

The perpose of the following files aims at giving a clear explanation for the SiC MOSFET turn-on transient in the conference paper "A Simplifed SiC MOSFET Model for an Abstract View of the Switching Performance".
